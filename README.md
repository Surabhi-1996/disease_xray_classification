# Classifying disease using Deep Learning

## We will automate the process of detecting and classifying chest diseases. 

- Deep learning proven to be superior in detecting and classifying disease using imagery data.The project is about to automate the process of detecting and classifying chest disease and reduce the cost and time of detection. Dataset contains 133 images that belong to 4 classes.
  - Healthy
  - Covid-19
  - Bacterial Pneumonia
  - Viral Pneumonia
- Use image generator to generate tensor images data and normalize them, split the data into training and validation.
- Visualize the dataset using matplotlib
- Import the model ResNet of pretrained weights
- Build and train deep learning model using Keras
- Use ModelCheckpoint to save the best model
- Evaluate trained deep learning model
